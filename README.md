# Simple Neural Network

A very basic neural network built **from scratch** using only NumPy.  
No frameworks used â€” great for learning how neural networks work internally.

### Features:
- One hidden layer
- Sigmoid activation
- XOR problem training example

### Run:
```bash
python neural_net.py
